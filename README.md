# SuperShredder

**SuperShredder** is a powerful, cross-platform security tool designed to securely erase data from Windows file systems and Android devices. Built with a modern, "hacker-style" frameless GUI using PyQt6, it ensures that deleted files are unrecoverable by utilizing military-grade encryption and multi-pass overwriting techniques.
**Self-Contained & Portable:** This tool comes with bundled ADB binaries, eliminating the need for complex system configuration. It also includes a build script to compile the application into a standalone `.exe` file.

## 🚀 Features

### 🖥️ Windows File Shredder
* **AES Encryption In-Place:** Before deletion, file content is overwritten with encrypted noise using AES (CBC mode) with a random key and IV.
* **Secure Overwrite:** Performs multiple passes of random data overwrites to ensure magnetic remanence cannot be used to recover data.
* **Metadata Obfuscation:** Renames files to random UUIDs before deletion to hide original filenames.
* **Free Space Wiping:** Fills free disk space with random data to prevent recovery of previously deleted files.

### 📱 Android Wiper
* **Smart Strategy Detection:** Automatically determines the best wiping method based on the device's Android version and encryption state.
    * **Crypto Wipe:** Used for encrypted devices (Android 6+).
    * **Factory Reset/Overwrite:** Used for older devices or emulators.
* **Device Management:** Auto-detects device states (Authorized, Unauthorized, Offline) and guides the user through ADB connection steps.
* **Emulator Support:** Detects if the connected device is an emulator and adjusts the wiping command accordingly.

### 🎨 User Interface
* **Modern Dark Theme:** Custom-styled, frameless window with a translucent background and rounded corners.
* **Easy Navigation:** Sidebar navigation to switch between Windows and Android modules.
* **Integrated Controls:** Custom minimize and exit buttons integrated into the UI.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x

### Steps
1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tarundeep1608/supershredder
    cd supershredder
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    Install the required Python packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Application**
    You have two options to run SuperShredder:

Option A: Run from Source Launch the application directly using Python:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```   
    
Option B: Build Standalone Executable. Use the provided build script to create a portable .exe file. This will bundle all dependencies and the ADB binaries into a single file.
   ```bash
   python build.py
   ```

The build script checks for adb.exe and DLLs in the bin/ folder and bundles them.
Once finished, the executable will be available at: dist/SuperShredder.exe
